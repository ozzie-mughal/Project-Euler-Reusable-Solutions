# Project-Euler-Reusable-Solutions
Parameterised solutions calculated for Project Euler problems

Simply run the function in main() and enter any user input required.

Solutions can be re-used for general purpose calculations of similar problems (eg. use MultiplesSumCalculator to calculate the sum of multiples of any given list of numbers within a provided upper bound) and include client-side validation.

Problem 1: 
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Solution Approach: Returns trailing sum of multiples of any given list of numbers within a provided upper bound.
